# FusionOptimization
"Codes" folder contains python files related to the Fusion Optimization.
Damir Kanymkulov created the folowing python files:
"Dataset.py" file contains a code that loads, preprocesses the code, and creates dataloaders which are convenient for training neural networks. The "intermediate_fusion.py" file has a code that performs an intermediate fusion of two MLP models with different data types (images, numerical data). The process of finding the best fusion location was optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The "late_fusion.py" file contains a code that performs training of two MLP models with different data types (images, numerical data) and prints an average of two results.
